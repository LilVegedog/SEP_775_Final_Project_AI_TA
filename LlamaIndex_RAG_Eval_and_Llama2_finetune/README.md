# Pipelines for RAG System Evaluation and Llama2-7b Finetuning 

## Folders explanation
This directory contains the following folders:
 1. src: Folder for the Jupyter Notebooks with the implementation of the pipelines
 2. data: Folder that contains the SEP775 course materials data (in txt and md formats), and sample questions generated using ChatGPT
 3. course\_materials\_db: Chroma VectorDB that was generated by running the Llama2_Finetuning_data_gen_pipeline notebook in src
 4. llm_finetune_data: Folder that contains the data for finetuning and evaluating finetuned Llama2-7b model, which was generated by running the Llama2_Finetuning_data_gen_pipeline
 notebook in src, and data inside will be required to run the Llama2_Finetune_Eval_pipeline_colab notebook.
 5. RAG_eval_results: Folder that contains the evaluation results of LlamaIndex RAG systems with different embedding model and hyper-parameters' choices, files inside were 
 generated by running the LlamaIndex_RAG_Evaluation in src 

## Execution
If you want to execute the Jupyter Notebooks in src locally, please make sure you have done the following steps:
 1. Import the backed up Anaconda environment from the conda_NLP_env.yaml file, then use the imported environment to run the notebooks
 2. Use notepad or other text editor to open the .env file in src, enter your Huggingface tokens and OpenAI API key then save the file
 3. The files that are generated by running the LlamaIndex_RAG_Evaluation and Llama2_Finetuning_data_gen_pipeline notebooks are already in the RAG_eval_results, 
 course\_materials\_db, and llm_finetune_data folders respectively. If you want to run these two notebooks, you would need to remove the existing files in these 3 folders 
 that are mentioned, since it might append on the existing files but not overwritting the files.
 4. The Llama2_Finetune_Eval_pipeline_colab notebook cannot be run locally, you would need to upload it onto Google Drive along with the course\_materials\_db Chroma vectorDB 
 and llm_finetune_data folders.
