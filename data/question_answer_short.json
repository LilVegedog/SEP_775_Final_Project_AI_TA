       "0":"The instructor's name of the course is Hamidreza Mahyar.",
       "1":"The email address of the instructor is mahyarh@mcmaster.ca.",
       "2":"This course is held every Wednesday from 3:30pm to 6:30pm.",
       "3":"The TA's name for this course is Reza Namazi.",
       "4":"Word2vec is a framework for learning word vectors, introduced by Mikolov et al. in 2013, which represents words in a fixed vocabulary by vectors and uses these vectors to maximize the probability of context words given a center word or vice versa.",
       "5":"The main learning goals include understanding the foundations of effective modern methods for deep learning applied to NLP, a big picture understanding of human languages and their processing challenges, and the ability to build systems in PyTorch for major NLP problems.",
       "6":"The course grade is distributed across 4 assignments (20%), 4 quizzes (10%), a midterm (35%), and a final group project (34%).",
       "7":"The policy is no free late days, with a deduction of 1% off the course grade per day late, and assignments are not accepted more than 3 days late unless permission is granted in advance.",
       "8":"The course aims to teach that word meaning can be represented well by a high-dimensional vector of real numbers, through the study of word vectors and their applications in NLP.",
       "9":"Word2vec represents word meaning using dense vectors chosen so that words appearing in similar contexts have similar vectors, measured by the vector dot product.",
       "10":"The main focus of this lecture is on Neural Networks, Gradients, and Backpropagation.",
       "11":"The non-linear functions mentioned include logistic, tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU, and GELU.",
       "12":"Non-linearities in neural networks enable the approximation of any complex function, allowing networks to perform tasks beyond simple linear transformations.",
       "13":"Cross entropy loss is used in PyTorch as the loss function for training models, particularly for classification tasks to minimize the negative log probability of the correct class.",
       "14":"The backpropagation algorithm is significant for computing gradients algorithmically, allowing for efficient training of neural networks by updating parameters to minimize loss.",
       "15":"The Jacobian matrix represents the partial derivatives of a function with multiple outputs and inputs, crucial for understanding how changes in inputs affect outputs.",
       "16":"The derivative with respect to a matrix is described using the shape convention, where the shape of the gradient is the shape of the parameters, facilitating easier computation.",
       "17":"Automatic differentiation plays a crucial role by inferring the gradient computation from the symbolic expression of the forward propagation, simplifying the implementation of backpropagation.",
       "18":"Manual gradient checking is used to verify the correctness of gradient implementations by comparing them with numerically approximated gradients, ensuring the accuracy of backpropagation.",
       "19":"Understanding gradients is important because it helps in debugging and improving models by providing insight into the underlying operations and potential issues with backpropagation.",
       "20":"The core concept introduced is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which is essential for understanding language models including GPT-3 and ChatGPT."
