Often, 2 layers are a lot better than 1, and 3 layers might be a little better than 2 layers. Usually, skip connections and dense connections are needed to train deeper RNNs, for example, 8 layers. Transformer-based networks like BERT are usually deeper, with 12 or 24 layers. \n\nSource: lecture03_RNNs_and_LLMs",

Skip connections allow the gradients to bypass certain layers, making it easier for the network to learn and optimize the weights effectively. Dense connections ensure that each layer has direct connections to every other layer, facilitating the flow of information and gradients throughout the network, which is crucial for training deeper RNNs effectively.\n\nSource: lecture03_RNNs_and_LLMs",
